Task 4 completed at CodeClause as Data Science Intern for August-September 2023

Task 4: Next Word Prediction 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dorianlazar/medium-articles-dataset/data

Next Word Prediction (also called Language Modeling) is the task of predicting what word comes next. It is one of the fundamental tasks of NLP.

Application of Language Modelling:
1) Mobile keyboard text recommandation
2) Google Search Engine

This is posible through natural language processing (NLP) technique.

Here, we will use NLP and try to make a prediction model using Bidirectional LSTM (Long short-term memory) model that will predict next words of sentence.

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks is an advance recurrent neural network which is apable to store order states by using its cell state feature.
